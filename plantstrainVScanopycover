We would like to examine the of canopy cover (over time) for each plant strain.
Variables
time(t)= MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS, 
canopy cover(c)= percentage

1. Choose a strain
2. Plot all instances of (t,c)
+2.5. Take average canopy cover for a give time.
3. Create a model appropriate for the data.
*4. Consider appropriate error bounds for this model (lower and upper).
*5. Discuss any outliers.
5. Repeat this process for another strain of the plant. 
6. Compare the time versus canopy cover models for each strain.

Questions:
Which plants tend to grow more quickly?
Are there plants that do not reach 100% canopy cover? 

+If we need to simplify the data. This will give less data points.
*If time permits
